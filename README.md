2: front_end.py provides the user end interface based on flask.
3: fetch_comments.py will be called from front_end.py on users request, this will fetch the
comments from fb using graph api for the given post url.
4: model_back.py will be called after all the comments being fetched, it will classify the new
requests i.e. , the comments fetched from fb.
5: model_result.py will be called from front_end.py it will call the model_back.py to classify
each comment from scrape_data.txt based on relevant features from relevant_feature.py
6: Results generated in model_result.py will be sent to front_end.py from where it can be
displayed on the user end, taking the help of wordc.py, sum.py and sumn.py in form of word
cloud registration, positive and negative summary generation respectively.
